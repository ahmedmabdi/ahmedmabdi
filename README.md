# Hi there, I'm Ahmed

I'm a DevOps Engineer with strong hands-on experience designing, automating, and deploying scalable cloud solutions on AWS. I work extensively with Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions, building production-style CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure that emphasise reliability, security, and automation.

I enjoy solving real problems through clean infrastructure design and transforming ideas into deployable systems that follow modern DevOps practices.
